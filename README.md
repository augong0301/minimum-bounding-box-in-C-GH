# Min Bbox in C&GH

This is a testing project of minimum bounding box algorithm.

There are two main parts of the algorithm.

:one: Rotating calipers

:two: Graham Scan

With the help of the two, the convex hull can be easily found and then the min bounding rectangle can be computed.

There still remains 2 problem in this project.

:one: This is a brief development of GH components, it may not be convenient for you to take a test on other platform.

:two: We only discussed a 2D algorithm of min Bbox, further development is on the way.
